# reach-out.html
* Practice for HTML heading, photo, and navigation links
* To recreate you need the image files or they will not display
* The webpage starts with the band's name and a large band photo. Immediately under the photo are navigation links to the various sections. Many websites have a different webpage for each section, but Reach Out uses a single webpage with links to each section.
